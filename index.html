  <h1>Empowering India's Tribes: The PESA Act 1996, Landmark Cases, Village Empowerment, and BJP's Transformative Role</h1>

  <p>The heart of Bharat lies in its adivasis and they’re the indigenous ones; those directly linked to the entire ecosystem of Bharat. Bringing about the 73rd Constitution was an overwhelming task done by the Union Government of India...</p>

  <p>There have been repeated cases of illegal land acquisition and illegal quarrying from several villages of Kolhan region in Jharkhand...</p>

  <p>...The Panchayat secretaries of the state miserably fail in understanding the local languages, many a times misinterpreting the deliberations in the Sabha...</p>

  <p>...The government should bring about reforms in administrative training and proper inculcation of customary laws in all the stakeholders of the government so as to ease down and make the process of integration and empowerment of real villages better and vibrant!</p>
