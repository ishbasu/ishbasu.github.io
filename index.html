  <h1>Empowering India's Tribes: The PESA Act 1996, Landmark Cases, Village Empowerment, and BJP's Transformative Role</h1>

  <p>The heart of Bharat lies in its adivasis and they’re the indigenous ones; those directly linked to the entire ecosystem of Bharat. Bringing about the 73rd Constitution was an overwhelming task done by the Union Government of India. It tremendously impacted the roots of the republic, strengthening the actual essence of a democratic nation like Bharat. But at the same time, a bone of contention lies in the scheduled areas, which can be tremendously helped with the implementation of PESA 1996. Despite having framed appropriate rules for the same, the state government of Jharkhand has repeatedly failed in ensuring viable solutions for the same.</p>

  <p>There have been repeated cases of illegal land acquisition and illegal quarrying from several villages of Kolhan region in Jharkhand. The years of 2004–07 and 2015–17 saw enormous agitations in the villages of Noamundi and Meghahataburu. Thalkobad and Bitkilsoy saw the maximum protests which were then led by NDA leader Saryu Roy and his NPO, “SAVE SARANDA.” The Madhu Koda–led state government proposed 19 mining leases under the Saranda forests. The same government also proposed renewed mining projects for nickel in the villages of Tiringpahar and Baraidih, which led to serious protests from 2009–2011. There is a great vacuum between the actualization and implementation of PESA rules in Jharkhand.</p>

  <p>Section 4 of the PESA 1996 empowers the gram panchayats to have exclusive control over minor forest produce and minor water resources. As a result of this, the then Tribal Affairs Minister in the Union Government launched the “Van-Dhan” Yojana, which led to the successful economic integration of forest produce, empowering the rural grassroots. 90% of the profit earned by bamboo workers in Gadchiroli has been retained by the farmers. Khunti district enjoys an annual profit of ₹2.5 crores through the Van-Dhan Yojana. However, there is no proper documentation of Gram Sabha resolutions, leading to discontent among rural people. Panchayat secretaries often fail to understand local languages, misinterpreting the deliberations in the Sabha, and there is also severe external bias in assessing the merit of the resolutions, often resulting in injustice.</p>

  <p>Speaking at the Republic Tribal Convention in 2022, former Union Cabinet Minister Shri Arjun Munda remarked, “The real parliament of the people are the Gram Sabhas, and the real empowerment of the village panchayats will lead to the strengthening of the republic.” Even during his tenure as Chief Minister of Jharkhand, he was instrumental in introducing draft regulations for PESA implementation, which was later slowed down due to a lack of enthusiasm in the governments of Hemant Soren and Raghubar Das.</p>

  <p>Tribals have a customary way of dispute resolution, and it is best that they are not interfered with. There should be proper digitization and commendation of panchayat resolutions. It should always be remembered by all leaders that the right to land is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution as propounded by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in <em>Samatha vs. State of Andhra Pradesh</em> (1997). Local language consultancy is an important part of the democratic framework as defined by the Jharkhand High Court in <em>Budhu Bhagat vs. State of Jharkhand</em> (2021). It must also be noted that any development depriving marginalized tribal communities would violate Article 25 of the Constitution as discussed in the <em>Orissa Mining Corporation vs. Ministry of Environment</em> (Niyamgiri Case) (2013).</p>

  <p>The government should bring about reforms in administrative training and properly inculcate customary laws in all government stakeholders to ease and improve the process of integration and empowerment of rural villages.</p>
